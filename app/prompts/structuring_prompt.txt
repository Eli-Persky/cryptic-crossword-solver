Please extract and structure this information according to the schema, ensuring:

1. **Attempted Solutions**: Include any partial or alternative solutions mentioned during the reasoning process
2. **Complete Solution**: The final solution if one is provided
3. **Definition**: The definition part identified in the reasoning
4. **Wordplay Components**: Each component should specify:
   - indicator: The exact word/phrase from the clue that signals this wordplay type
   - wordplay_type: One of: anagram, charade, container, contents, reversal, hidden, homophone, deletion, selection, replacement, link
   - target: The specific words from the clue that this wordplay operates on

The types of wordplay which may be used are:
   - Anagram indicators (mixed, confused, broken, etc.) whih target a word or words to be jumbled
   - Container indicators (in, inside, around, etc.) which target the word to contain another or be contained by another
   - Reversal indicators (back, reverse, returns, rising, etc.) which target the word to be reversed
   - Hidden word indicators (some, part of, within, etc.) which target the phrase containing the hidden word
   - Deletion indicators (without, losing, drops, etc.) which target the words that indicate the letters to be deleted
   - Homophone indicators (sounds, heard, spoken, etc.) which target the words which are a homophone for the solution

Note any word in the clue which is replaced by a synonym or abbreviation should be considered a 'charade' wordplay component which has no target.

Make sure to capture all the wordplay components identified in the reasoning and map them to the correct types and targets from the original clue.
